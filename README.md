# Beverage Sales – Power BI Dashboards

Interactive Power BI project based on a synthetic beverage sales dataset.  
I built four dashboards (State & Region, Brand, Retailer, Monthly) with shared slicers for date, region, state, retailer and brand.

Key metrics:
- Revenue, Total Units Sold, Avg Revenue per Unit, Retailer Count  
- Top states and retailers by revenue and volume  
- Brand performance and monthly seasonality trends

The report is designed to mimic the view a trade/sales analyst in a beverage company would use to understand where revenue is coming from and how it changes over time.
